# MEGAMEAL — Post Format Reference

## Site Info
- **URL:** megameal.org
- **Repo path:** `apps/megameal/src/content/posts/your-slug.md` (or `.mdx`)
- **File format:** `.md` or `.mdx` (MDX allows JSX/Svelte components inside markdown)
- **Images:** Place in `apps/megameal/public/blog-images/` — reference as `/blog-images/filename.jpg`

## Schema Notes
- `bannerType` can be: `image`, `video`, `timeline`, or `assistant`
- For video banners use `bannerData.videoId` (YouTube video ID)
- For image banners use `bannerData.imageUrl` (**NOT** `image` — different from other sites!)
- `oneColumn: true` for wide full-width layout
- `authorLink` should be `/about/slug/` if the author has a profile page
- `mascotContext` — plain English summary for the AI chatbot — no markdown, just 1-2 sentences
- Valid `timelineEra` values: `awakening-era`, `golden-age`, `conflict-epoch`, `singularity-wars`
- `tags` must be an array: `[Tag1, Tag2]`
- `draft: false` to publish, `draft: true` to hide
- If using `.mdx` you can embed Svelte/JSX components in the content
